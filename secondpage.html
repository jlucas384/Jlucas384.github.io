<h1>Expansion</h1>
<p>Lacrosse expanded from only native americans to being played by the Europeans in the early 17th century. The Jesuits were shocked by the game and how interesting it looked so they decided to give it a try. The name of lacrosse comes from the French and how they saw the shape of the stick as a cross.  </p>

    <h1>Influence</h1>
    <p>Lacrosse was played for years on until it became an organized sport in the 19th century. The first ever organized game was played in Montreal with the Montreal lacrosse club. The game was influenced by many European settlers and by this time there were rules set up to keep the game flowing. A man by the name of William George Beers was a huge influence in the rules. He was a part of the Montreal Lacrosse club.

    <h1>Equipment</h1>
    <p>Over time the equipment began to grow with the growth of the sport. Slowly the lacrosse stick became more and more evolved, while also the materials to make the ball and nets became easier to access and lighter. As time went on more and more there began to be gear implemented. Players started wearing helmets and gloves and slowly moved onto what we have to wear today.</p>
